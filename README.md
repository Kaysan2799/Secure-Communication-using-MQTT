# Secure-Communication-using-MQTT
This repository implements a custom encryption and decryption system using a dynamic matrix based on a password and the current datetime. Encryption includes padding, fixed shuffling, substitution using an S-box, column replacement, and XOR with a dynamic matrix. Decryption reverses these steps. Encrypted messages are transmitted via MQTT.
